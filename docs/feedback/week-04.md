# Meeting Week 4 - 04-Dec-2024
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the the points
- the general template is good, but I the agenda is a little too long (the meeting is supposed to last 45 minutes, not 60)
- most of the points were clearly formulated, but I would suggest to split the "brainstorm" point into clear points that can be discussed 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- the notes have been merged, and there is a good amount of notes
- there are concrete agreements, but they are missing a time unit. I would assume they are for the upcoming meeting, but in the future you might want to add a shorter time limit, as some functionality depends on another one


#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- all items were covered, but some of the times were not accurate. I would suggest to pay a little more attention when creating the agenda

#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- everyone was active during the meeting, generally listening to all ideas and coming with their own point. However, at some point, I noticed people talking over each others. I would suggest to focus on one point at a time

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- there is a working application and progress compared to the last week
- The team on a good track to create a working application until project end


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- the action list of last week was discussed and it seems like everyone worked on diffenet parts of the project. All assigned tasks were completed in time, good job!
