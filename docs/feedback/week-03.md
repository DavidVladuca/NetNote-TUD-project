# Meeting Week 3 - 27-Nov-2024
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the points
- the general template is good, but I think that some of the points can be merged (for example the opening and the check-in)
- the points were clearly formulated, so everyone had the chance to prepare them

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- the notes were properly added to the repo, and the format is good
- in general the notes seem clear, however some of them might need to be a little more organised. For exmaple, the following note: "two other people need to review the code and write at least 100 chairs comment For AI - document it in a shared document Every merge request should be 20-30 lines of code Write JavaDoc" can be split into multiple bulletpoints
- there are some concrete agreements, however they are not properly organised (the "Summarize action points : Who , what , when ? (10 min )" point in the agenda is empty). I would suggest to clearly state in the minutes the tasks for everyone in the upcoming week (it's also easier for me to provide constructive feedback based on these) 

#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- all topics were properly covered
- the expected time for the meeting was 80 minutes instead of 45. In the end, everything was discussed in the 45-mintue time frame, which is a good thing, but I would suggest to have better time approximations for the next meetings


#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Everyone was active during this meeting, I love the improvement from last week :D
- The atmosphere was constructive and everyone listened to most of the ideas/comments/questions. However, from time to time, there were discussions in small pairs (2-3 people), so not everyone was able to listen to everything and contribute to all ideas. I'd suggest in the future to focus on one point at a time
- at the end, some members (including the minute taker) were already packing their things, while the chair was still talking. I'd suggest to wait for the chair to formally close the meeting, as there was some relevant information discussed which was not noted anywhere


#### Potentially Shippable Product
Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 
- good start, but not shippable product yet


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- the students discussed (some of) the goals of the last week, but it was hard for me to follow all of them, as they were not clearly stated anywhere. I would suggest to make a clear overview of the work and post it somewhere (notes can be updated, another document is also fine, issues can also work, but everyone needs to have some assigned ones and be sure that you discuss all of them in the upcoming meeting)
