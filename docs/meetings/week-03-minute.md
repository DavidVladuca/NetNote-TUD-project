- Planned meeting duration != actual duration ? Where / why did you mis-estimate ? (? min )
    Meeting was shorter, brainstorming took less minutes, progress discussion took more like 3-4 minutes instead of 5-10, also some things that were planned to take
    a short amount of time took even shorter amount of time and when that adds up it is kinda a lot of minutes

    No questions were asked
